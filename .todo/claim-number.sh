# Claim the next todo number(s) atomically, so two sessions never pick the same one.
#
#   .todo/claim-number.sh "<why>" [count]
#
# Prints the claimed number(s), one per line. The claim is the push: the counter
# lives in ONE file on the orphan branch `todo-seq`, so two sessions racing for a
# number race for the same file, and git rejects the loser instead of merging both
# (which is exactly what two differently-named .todo/NNN-*.md files do). The loser
# re-reads and retries.
#
# Uses plumbing only -- no checkout, no index, no stash. Safe from any worktree,
# with uncommitted changes, mid-task. `todo-seq` shares no history with main
# and must never be merged into it.
#
# The counter is authoritative but not omniscient: a session that has not adopted
# this script can still file a number behind its back (that happened the hour the
# branch was created). So each claim also reads what main actually uses -- live
# `.todo/NNN-*.md` files, the artefact directories under `.todo/artefacts/` that
# outlive them, AND the numbers recorded in `.todo/history/` -- and skips past
# anything already taken, healing the counter in the same push. That check is what
# makes a manual cross-check afterwards unnecessary.
#
# A number is always three characters. Past 999 the first character continues 0-9
# with a-z (999 -> a00, a99 -> b00, ... up to z99), so names still sort in claim
# order and no existing reference changes width. `NEXT` holds the plain decimal
# ordinal (1000 is a00).
